***Welcome to ClimateState!***

`ClimateState` is a library designed for visualizing the state of climate in atmosphere and ocean. It goes beyond merely presenting figures; it also showcases the underlying code that generates these visual representations. This is particularly beneficial for students and researchers, as it offers a transparent view into the process of climate data visualization, thereby fostering an environment of transparency and educational growth in the realm of climate science.

## Features
To be added

## Methods
We use monthly gridded observation/reanalysis datasets listed as follows

- Sea surface temperature
    * NOAA Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature (ERSST) V5 obtained from <https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.noaa.ersst.v5.html>

    * HadISST obtained from <https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadisst/>

    * COBE SST obtained from <https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.cobe.html>

- Precipitation

  * CPC Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP) obtained from <https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.cmap.html>

- ERA5 reanalysis

- ORAS5 ocean reanalysis

All the climatology is calculated using the period of 1991-2020, unless specifically stated otherwise.
