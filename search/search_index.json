Documentation: https://senclimate.github.io/climatestate/ ClimateState is a library designed for visualizing the state of climate in atmosphere and ocean. It goes beyond merely presenting figures; it also showcases the underlying code that generates these visual representations. This is particularly beneficial for students and researchers, as it offers a transparent view into the process of climate data visualization, thereby fostering an environment of transparency and educational growth in the realm of climate science. Under development note Please note that the library is currently under development, and as such, certain pages may be temporarily unavailable. Those sections will be updated soon. Why Create ClimateState Library? \u00b6 When I was a graduate student, I found climate atlases to be invaluable tools. They were beneficial not only for the rich materials and captivating visuals used in lectures by our professors but also as a reference point in my research endeavors. Since then, I would draw inspiration from their methods of illustration and colorbars. These atlases include: ERA-40 Atlas provided by ECMWF Atlas of Climate of Global Atmospheric Circulation I. Climatological Mean State by Prof. Jianping Li , who is my PhD supervisor. Climate Variability Diagnostics Package for Large Ensembles (CVDP-LE) developed by NCAR CESM1/2 Large Ensembles 1920-2100 MMLEA 1950-2018 MMLEA 2019-2099 CMIP6 Historical/SSP585 1900-2100 KNMI Climate Change Atlas IRI Climate and Society Map Room provided by IRI/LDEO U.S. Climate Atlas These invaluable atlases, however, often lacked modern datasets or accessible code for in-depth analysis and replication of results. Recognizing this gap, I was motivated to create the ClimateState Library that powers climate visualizations. Features \u00b6 To be added Creator \u00b6 Dr. Sen Zhao is the project creator and primary contributor. He is an Assistant Researcher at University of Hawaii at Manoa\u2019s Department of Atmospheric Science. More details refer to his work .
